# Eat-Da-Burger!

As traveler and burger lover, I wanted to be able to log all the burgers I have accoss the world. Eat-Da-Burger is a handy tool to accomplish such a task.

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Installation
This repo consists of front end and back end files. To run this app locally after cloning the repo, run npm install to get all the dependecies installed, then run the command line: node server. Now open http://localhost:8080 in your browser of choice.
